## Description

This weather application uses third-party API's to retrieve weather from destinations while traveling. I built this web application to show a 5-day forecast of any destination that I would be going to. It not only shows the weather, but it breaks the weather down into temperature, humidity, wind speed, and even UV Index. During the development of this web application I successfully learned how to use a third-party API. I now know that I can use these in my future of developing new applications.

## Usage

To use this application simply go to (), enter your destination in the top left corner search bar. The results will show to the right of the screen. Below are a couple screenshots to demonstrate the functionality.
